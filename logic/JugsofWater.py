# Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but
# no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water? Note that the jugs
# are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

# first i will fild the 5 jug until the end
# move the water to the 3 jug
# now i have 2/5 and 3/3
# will trow the water from the 3 jug
# will move the 2 L from the 5 jug to the 3 jug
# will file the 5 one more time
# move 1 L from the 5 jug to the 3 jug ( had 2 L before)
# now i have 4 L in the 5 jug
