# Blue-Eyed Island: A bunch of people are living on an island, when a visitor comes with a strange
# order: all blue-eyed people must leave the island as soon as possible. There will be a flight out at
# 8:00 pm every evening. Each person can see everyone else's eye color, but they do not know their
# own (nor is anyone allowed to tell them). Additionally, they do not know how many people have
# blue eyes, although they do know that at least one person does. How many days will it take the
# blue-eyed people to leave?

# we know that we have one more more Blue-eyes so it will be B (num of blue-eyes)
# let say that if someone know he have blue-eye he will go fly-up
# so it will take B days untill they know
# start from 1 - B
# if only 1 have blue-eye he will see that no-one have blue-eye so he know he need to fly
# if 2 have , they see each one , and know that they will fly, but they didnt so it will be next day
# if 3 each see 2 ppl and after 2 day he still see then so he know he have also blue-eye so he will fly with them
# and until B
