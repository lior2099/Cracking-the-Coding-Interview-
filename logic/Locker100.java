        Next, he closes every second locker. Then, on his third pass, he toggles every third locker (closes it if
        it is open or opens it if it is closed). This process continues for 100 passes, such that on each pass i,

        SOLUTION -
            we need to find the odd the

            The value x is odd if n is a perfect square. Here's why: pair n's factors by their complements. For example,
            if n is 36, the factors are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), (6, 6). Note that (6, 6) only contributes
            one factor, thus giving n an odd number of factors.

            so it will be
            [1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25, 36 , 49, 64 , 81 , 100 ] 10
